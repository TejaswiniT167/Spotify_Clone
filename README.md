# Spotify Clone

## Overview
I designed a front-end clone of the Spotify User Home Page, using only HTML and CSS, to replicate the clean and user-friendly interface of the official Spotify website. This project was created as a way to practice and demonstrate my front-end development skills, focusing on CSS grid and flexbox to ensure the layout was both responsive and visually appealing.

The goal was to closely mimic the design elements and functionality seen on Spotify's actual home page without making the clone interactive. This included the navigation bar, main content area with featured playlists, and the footer section. Special attention was given to the color scheme and typography to keep the visual experience as authentic as possible.

Through this project, I refined my ability to translate visual designs into code, enhancing my understanding of CSS styling and HTML structure. It served as a valuable exercise in applying basic web development principles to recreate a popular and commercially successful user interface.
